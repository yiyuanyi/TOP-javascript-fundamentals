I found several of these exercises simple and straight forward (helloWorld, repeatString, reverseString, tempConversion, leapYears)
but I also struggled a lot with some of the tasks (particularly removeFromArray, sumAll)

These exercises have helped me improve searching for specific phrases that help to solve a smaller part of a problem instead of the whole problem (this still needs some work as I ended up looking at other people's solutions for the harder tasks, coming to understand how they worked, and using it for my own solution). They have also started my development on TDD, which will improve with more experience. 

It has also reminded me to keep my code as simple as possible, as quite often I was over complicating simple things that I could do and instead replacing it with more complicated code that I do not fully understand.

Several were fine, with some being frustrating one night but then solvable after leaving it for a day. 
Struggling with the Caesar one and Fibonacci also looks hard. Update when all are completed.

Try not to overcomplicate things. Write it the simplest way first, then modify it after.

Got fibonacci working after googling.

Caesar was very hard, couldn't get it to work with my own assigned array so used unicode instead.
Required help from TOP discord to sort out the punctuation problem and then looked at previous peoples questions for the wrap and large number shifts.
Code works fine, is rather long and uneloquent. Will update it soon to make it shorter/more readable as many repeated statements in the if () sections.
