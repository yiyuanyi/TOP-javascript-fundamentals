# TOP-javascript-fundamentals-4
repository containing my solutions for TOP JS fundamentals 4 exercises found here https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises

I found several of these exercises simple and straight forward (helloWorld, repeatString, reverseString, tempConversion, leapYears)
but I also struggled a lot with some of the tasks (particularly removeFromArray, sumAll)

These exercises have helped me improve searching for specific phrases that help to solve a smaller part of a problem instead of the whole problem (this still needs some work as I ended up looking at other people's solutions for the harder tasks, coming to understand how they worked, and using it for my own solution). They have also started my development on TDD, which will improve with more experience. 

It has also reminded me to keep my code as simple as possible, as quite often I was over complicating simple things that I could do and instead replacing it with more complicated code that I do not fully understand.

I will revisit the tasks in the future to show my progress.
